# LombokTask ðŸš€

Welcome to **LombokTask** â€“ a simple Java project demonstrating how to eliminate boilerplate code using **Lombok**. This project was created with a Maven Archetype and features a `Car` class with only fields, along with a `Main` class to show off Lombokâ€™s auto-generated methods.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- **Project Type:** Maven (created via Maven Archetype)
- **Language:** Java
- **Key Library:** [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)  
  Lombok helps reduce repetitive code by generating getters, setters, constructors, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods at compile time.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Java** (version 17 or above)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **Lombok** (version 1.18.32)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (recommended IDE)

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure


- **`pom.xml`**: Contains Maven configurations and the Lombok dependency.
- **`Car.java`**: A simple Java class annotated with Lombok to auto-generate common methods.
- **`Main.java`**: The entry point of the application that creates and compares two `Car` objects.
